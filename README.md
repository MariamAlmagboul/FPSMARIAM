The player must have two types of weapons. A smaller one, with a slow and precise cadence, like a pistol, and another with long range and rapid fire, like a machine gun. (10 points).
In addition to a life bar, the player will also have a shield bar. When they are shot, if he/she still has a shield, it will be the shield that takes most of the damage, but the player will still have to lose a little life. When the shield reaches 0, then the health will take 100% of the damage. (10 points).
Both the amount of life, shield, type of weapon and ammunition must always be seen on the screen (HUD) (10 points).
There should be doors that cannot be opened if the player does not have the appropriate "key" (20 points).
There must be “enemies” patrolling the scene and if they see you they will start shooting at you. If you pass by them but they have not seen you (pretending that they have heard your steps), they must make a 360-degree turn looking for you before continuing with their patrol. (20points).
The game must be fully sound-tracked. Steps, pick up an item, be wounded or hurt, shoot, jump, fall, open door (10 points)
The game must have a game over screen and when we die we can restart the level (10 points).
